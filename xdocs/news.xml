			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 0.4</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>This release includes bug fixes and some cleanup to the jFLAC library:
			<ul>
   				<li>A fix was made to Player.java to flush all output to the device before closing the line.</li>
   				<li>Modified the Player.java app so that one instance can play back multiple files.</li>
   				<li>Added a decodeStreamInfo and decodeFrame function to StreamDecoder.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>jFLAC is a java port of the <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net">Free Lossless Audio Codec</a> which
			is also hosted on SourceForge. The current code base support decoding FLAC files to WAV files. The
			encoder is not currently supported. Any comments, suggestions, and help is welcome.</p>

			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 0.4</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>This release features a new player application that will play a flac file
			using the Java sound API. I've also added new listener interfaces to the library.
			The FrameListener is called after every flac packet is processed. This is now
			used by the Analyser application. The PCMProcessor is called after every frame
			is decoded. This is now used by the Decoder application</p>
