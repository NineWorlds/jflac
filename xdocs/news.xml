			<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=106536">Version 0.2</a> released!</p>
			<p>I am pleased to announce an updated release of the jFLAC library.</p>
			<p>This release fixes two separate bugs with the library:
			<ul>
   				<li>Decoding LPC subframes generated a NullPointerException.</li>
   				<li>WAV files Decoded from 16 bps and 24 bps FLAC files were incorrect.</li>
			</ul></p>
			<p>jFLAC is a java port of the <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net">Free Lossless Audio Codec</a> which
			is also hosted on SourceForge. The current code base support decoding FLAC files to WAV files. The
			encoder is not currently supported. Any comments, suggestions, and help is welcome.</p>
